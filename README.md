# 🛡️ TrustDrop

**TrustDrop** is a secure **Two-Factor Handover (2FH)** verification system built to solve the trust gap in African e-commerce.  
It ensures deliveries are only marked as **Successful** when a customer provides a unique release code to the rider, verified instantly via **USSD**.

> **Note:** This project was developed for the **Africa's Talking Hackathon (2026)** to demonstrate the power of **low‑tech, high‑security** solutions for the _next billion users_.

## 🚀 The Problem

In many African markets:

- **Pay on Delivery** → Risky for sellers (cash theft, rider fraud)
- **Pre‑payment** → Risky for customers (non‑delivery)

**TrustDrop bridges this gap** by replacing physical trust with a **digital handshake**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **Automated 2FA** – Generates a 4‑digit release code upon dispatch
- 📶 **Offline Verification** – Riders verify via USSD (no internet required)
- 📊 **Real‑time Dashboard** – Instant delivery status updates
- 🌍 **Africa's Talking Integration** – SMS & USSD powered communication
